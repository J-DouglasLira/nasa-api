            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 227, “How to Build Orion.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We've discussed NASA's Artemis program, the one that's returning humans to the Moon as a sustainable program. Part of making this possible is thinking ahead. So when we talk about gearing up for Artemis I, we have a lot of people focused on Artemis II, and even III. On this episode, we're going to talk about some of that planning, namely with the Orion spacecraft, the part that humans will live and work in during those first Artemis missions. Specifically, we're going to start from the ground up on how Orion spacecraft are manufactured for Artemis missions, and where four of those spacecraft are today. To discuss this, we're bringing in Ned Penley, who was the manager of the Orion program's Planning and Control Office when we recorded this and has since been promoted to the deputy associate administrator for management for the Exploration Systems Development and Space Operations Mission Directorates. We're also bringing in Stu McClung, the chief of staff of the Orion program's Planning and Control Office. So let's get right into it, and learn what it takes to build Orion. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Ned and Stu! Thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Ned Penley: Happy to be here.  Stu McClung: Yes, thanks. Looking forward to having the discussion with you. It should be fun.  Host: How to build Orion. That's what we're going to be talking about today. Both of you are -- maybe one of the ways that we can describe your jobs is very intricate project management, making sure that an Orion is built all across the country and that it meets the right qualifications. You have all the relationships. So that's what we're going to dive into today. I hope I'm describing your jobs correctly, though. But instead of me doing it, I'll toss it over to you. Ned, we'll start with you. In terms of your role as the manager of Orion program planning and control, what exactly does that mean? What exactly do you oversee?  Ned Penley: Yes, that's a good question. Thank you. It's funny, a lot of people ask me that, you know, what is program planning and control? It's not a usual title. My job is best related as, I manage the business office. So I manage the, the budgets and the schedule and something called configuration management. That's kind of making sure that the, the paperwork is, is in line, and that we can actually describe what it is we have built and that we all know exactly what it is that is built, and a few other things: export control, just making sure that the data is controlled in a secure way. And that’s, that’s, pretty much covers it.  Host: Alright. And Stu, you're also in the same office. Now what is, what is your role?  Stu McClung: Yeah, I'm really Ned's chief of staff. So I work, I do whatever Ned tells me to do, or at least I pretend to. So I'm an engineer, I've been on the program a number of years, I’m an engineer by background, and so I bring an engineer's point of view to Ned's office. And I have a lot of, my focuses are on what kind of risks and threats are coming that the program might have to deal with, that the finance side will need to adjust to, and so I kind of reach across to other offices within the organization and try to smooth out and make sure that the technical content of developing this vehicle and building this vehicle are, are kind of in sync with the financial aspect that Ned has to manage.  Host: Making the whole thing work. A very, very important job. But we're talking about Orion here, and I want to set some context for our listeners on exactly what that is. So Ned, if you had to give a brief overview on just what this is, what you're talking about, this program that you're overseeing and make work, what is Orion?  Ned Penley: Sure. So the Orion is, is the nation's next exploration spacecraft. We'll take humans further than humans have ever gone in space: around the Moon and to the lander that is going to land a woman on the Moon and a person of color on the Moon. The Orion spacecraft itself is really three different pieces. It's a capsule, where the crew members ride in, it's the propulsion system, the thing that rides on the back of the capsule, kind of pushes it around the Moon, and then it's the launch abort system, which is kind of the ejection seat, if you will, like an aircraft -- if there's something that's untoward that happens, the launch abort system can pull the capsule to safety.  Host: So a lot of different components. Now, what is the overall mission, Ned, when you're talking about here's this vehicle, here's what it's going to do, what exactly is the purpose of Orion as part of this overall, overall structure here?  Ned Penley: Yeah, good. The Orion is part of the Artemis, overall Artemis program, and the Artemis is, will again, take the first woman and a person of color to, to the Moon. So the Orion spacecraft itself is really the transportation of the humans from the Earth to the Moon. It goes from the launch pad, it rides on the top of the, the giant SLS (Space Launch System) rocket. And then, we'll take the crew all the way to orbit the Moon, and then dock with the lander. And a couple of folks from the Orion capsule will get into the lander, go down to the Moon, do their work, come back to the Orion and then Orion provides that transportation back from the Moon to the Earth.  Host: So that's a pretty important job, and there's a lot of things going through my head on what exactly are all of the components to actually make that Orion, that space capsule, do what it's supposed to do. And there has to be a lot of different elements, because today's topic is building Orion. And so, there's a lot of pieces that have to come together to make this work. So Stu, if you were looking specifically at the Orion vehicle, and now getting into the discussion of building Orion, what are some of those components that are being brought into the capsule to construct this vehicle?  Stu McClung: Great question. And it's interesting, as a very complex vehicle with a lot of different parts. And so, the build process and the construction process is interesting. It starts, you know, it starts really early on when we get, like Ned gave you the overview of what the mission is, right, the mission gets defined and that definition gets broken down a little bit further for each of the various systems because I, you know, we said alright, we're going to carry four astronauts out to the vicinity of the Moon and back, right, that's my mission requirement. And then I start looking at, alright, I need structure to do that. I need computers, avionics, I need communication systems, power systems. And the different scientists and engineers, right, we kind of, that process starts with them, either starting on a blank piece of paper, or starting with code, starting with, you know, a CAD (computer-aided design) system, and they start to build and design those components, right? And we get that initial \"what are my requirements\" and we lay that out, and we turn them on and say, let's go build something. So that's kind of, that's the first domino in the process.  Host: So, so Ned, what are those, what are those checkpoints at each of those dominoes? So if you have your components, what are the things that you're doing along the way to make sure that you're not missing a step to make sure you're getting all of the different requirements that you need, whether it's components, whether it's verification, whether it's testing? What are those key, key points in constructing Orion?  Ned Penley: Yeah, good. You know, NASA has learned over the years that they have to have these checkpoints where, you know, you've got groups of engineers are doing their thing, they're making assumptions, they're meeting their requirements, they're up for their little piece. And then you have to kind of bring all that together, bring the whole team together and say, OK, are we, are we on track, and are you guys, you know, over here building whatever their system, is it going to interface with the other systems correctly? And we call those design reviews. Preliminary Design Review is a typical one that you have a little bit early on, and then Critical Design Review: Critical Design Review is when most of your drawings are finished and stuff, and it's sort of, I'll call it the last check, if you will, to say, OK, are we ready to actually go build this, and, you know, cut metal and stitch all this stuff together? So, PDR, Preliminary Design Review, and CDR, Criterial Design Review, those are some key design points where we get the whole team together, and make sure, you know, just double check, if you will, that we're on track. So we had our Critical Design Review in 2015; said are we ready to go, we decided we were ready, and started stitching this thing all together, and now we have a vehicle stacked in the Kennedy Space Center and it's getting ready to go. Stu McClung: One of the things, the way I like to visualize is sometimes if you think about, think about an orchestra, right, and you've got a percussion system, you've got violins, and you've got the cellos, and you name it, right? And all of these experts are experts on, on that instrument, right? And at these checkpoints coming together, and it's like, alright, we're going to play as a team, we're going to have this integrated, beautiful music. I mean, really, that's kind of, for somebody that doesn't build complex vehicles, I like to think of it that way, because it's a way you can visualize it.  Host: Yeah, yeah, nice little comparison: every, every instrument in an orchestra is critical to making it sound the way it's supposed to sound. Otherwise, you have an incomplete piece. A very, very interesting -- comparison, for sure. Stu, to build off of that, to build off of Ned's comments, let's start with, you said, I think it was, from what Ned said, I think CDR was in 2015, then you talked about cutting metal and those sorts of things, and building it until it's stacked. That's, a lot has happened in that timeframe, right, from the time that you passed that Critical Design Review to the time that it is now stacked on top of a rocket? A brief overview of just some of the things that were accomplished in that time to, to make that possible, to go from constructing, making sure you had all of those different components, to saying this is ready to go on top of a rocket.  Stu McClung: Yeah. Great, great question. You know, and so along the way, we've had a couple of some major tests. We flew EFT (Exploration Flight Test)-1 back in December of 2014, and, right, that was, we basically built an early version of the vehicle and ran a test, really good successful test flight, and proved out sort of at on an interim basis what, the design was meeting our expectations, right? And then we flew Ascent Abort-2 back in July of 2019 to specifically look at the launch abort system. And so, we've had a couple of those test flights, which are a different type of a checkpoint, right? Sort of a dry run and a rehearsal. And now, really, leading up to Artemis I, which will happen in the spring, which is really our next big test flight, we're going to prove to ourselves that the testing that we've done on the ground, the analysis that the engineers have done along the way, that when it's all stitched together the vehicle's going to operate the way we expect it to operate, right? We've got a lot of test objectives that we intend to exercise and meet when we fly.  Host: Very critical step to build Orion is to verify that once you put it together it's going to work, and those tests seem to be a very critical part. Now the parts themselves, Stu, an overview of some of those parts, right, because you're procuring them from all over -- you know, where are the solar arrays coming from, where are they pyros coming from, where are the avionics coming from -- to actually bring it together and get to a point where you're ready to test it.  Stu McClung: Oh, yeah. Great question. It's interesting, one of the things in my past, I've worked on some of that hardware, and this is not, it’s a U.S.-effort: there's vendors all across the country, suppliers all across the country, and we're partnered with ESA (European Space Agency). They provide the service module. And so, there's actually hardware coming in from Europe. And so, it kind of depends on what you're looking at. Let me start with avionics, right, the computers and the other avionics that, you know, provide the command and control of the vehicle, come from a handful of vendors across the country. You know, Lockheed Martin is our prime contractor, and Honeywell is one of their major subcontractors. And so, you've got teams, they've got teams in Florida, they've got teams in Arizona that are building up the hardware. Solar arrays, that's another good one because that one's a nice, complicated -- they're not complicated, they're complex -- the actual solar cells are built by a company here in the U.S. We ship them over to the Netherlands, to RUAG, which is one of the suppliers in the ESA supply chain; they assembly the solar array itself, and get it built up, it then goes to Bremen in Germany, where Airbus and ESA assemble the vehicle for some testing. It gets tested with the vehicle there, then it actually gets shipped separate from the service module, along with the service module, back to Florida for all the final assembly and testing of the vehicle, alright? So the solar arrays come from parts all over the place. I’ve – you mentioned pyros as well. Pyrotechnic vendors, we've got some on the West Coast, got some in the Northeast; in fact, the fairings, the flanges that we use to separate the fairings as we climb uphill, the, the structure of the fairing is built in Minnesota. The fairing is -- the frangible assembly is built up in Connecticut, they are then shipped to our facility in New Orleans where the fairing is finally assembled, and that goes to Florida. You know, there's parts trucking and flying all across the country that all end up coming together as we build the vehicle down at our assembly facility at Kennedy Space Center.  Host: And Stu, that's something I find incredibly fascinating, just how many, how many commercial and international partners are involved to make this work. And Ned, Stu mentioned the partnership with ESA, and it seems like there's, you know, that we have that partnership with the service module, we also have, we're sending them over with different contractors over in, in Europe; that has to be, you know -- talk about the relationship with -- because we're talking about the Orion capsule, the service module is a critical component, how does that relationship work, and making sure that all requirements are met to, to make this mission possible?  Ned Penley: Yeah, yeah. It's, it’s really cool. So this is more than just a U.S. spacecraft. This is an international cooperative to build this spacecraft, as Stu mentioned. And you know, NASA has a history of cooperating with other countries. You know, the International Space Station was built with a cooperative -- ESA, Canada, Russia. And the cool part about this is there is a linkage there. So the agreements that we had set up for the International Space Station, we actually leveraged some of those agreements. There was some, some, some cost that was owed from ESA to the U.S., and we said, hey why don't you build the, the service module, the propulsion piece of the Orion spacecraft, and they had the capability of doing that; that offset their cost. So it was actually a win-win for everybody. And we wound up striking this agreement, and so it's just an extension, if you will, of the cooperative that we have as an agency, as a country, with other countries to get this done. I think it's pretty cool the way that that has worked out. You know, everybody, everybody has a piece of it.  Host: Everybody has a piece, and we're all trying to contribute to, to enabling human missions to the Moon. That's what we talked about in the very, in the very beginning. So let's get into the missions, and just how building Orion is contributing to the missions themselves. Stu, I'll pass it over to you, because what Ned said before was that it's stacked, it's in Florida now -- and that is for the purpose of stacking that vehicle on top is for the Artemis I mission. Now what are the objectives of the Artemis I mission? Why did we build this Orion to fly, to fly Artemis I?  Stu McClung: Excellent question; thanks. Yes, I mean, I'd like to sort of think of Artemis I as my -- not my; our, right? -- our last really big test drive, if you want to think of it as a vehicle, right, before we go put the crew in there, right? The crew's in a sense, the crew's my final stakeholder and customer, right? And this is our chance, our opportunity, again, to prove to ourselves that this vehicle will operate and behave the way we expect it to. And so we understand the risks appropriately to go and then put crew in it on Artemis II.  You know, we have a mission stacked full of flight test objectives, everything from, you know, verifying that the communications system works as smoothly as we expect, able to uplink commands; you know, we touched on solar arrays earlier, we've got predicted performance on how much power the solar arrays will generate, and how much power the vehicle will use. And now we're, you know, the orchestra's together, and we'll prove that in an integrated system, right? We'll look at that. The cooling system, the same thing. We'll look at how the vehicle cooling system works and maintains temperatures in the cabin and across the different parts of the structure. The propulsion system we'll get to operate. We've tested the propulsion system heavily on the ground, and in labs, and now this will be the full-up system test. And then one of the really key objectives happens right at the end: we'll get a good test of our heat shield. This is really the biggest heat shield for a human capsule that's built, right? We're about a 16-foot diameter vehicle. And you come back from a lunar re-entry you're traveling at extremely high rates of speed; we've tested in the lab, we've tested in the arcjet, we've analyzed. We had an earlier test on EFT-1 that was at a lower speed and lower energy; this gives us a lunar re-entry velocity to verify that the heat shield design is ready to go and ready to give the crew a good, safe mission and return. So it's all of that sort of stuff all stitched together. And we'll launch, do a quick orbit in low-Earth orbit, get the solar arrays out, get the early system checkout, and then head out towards the Moon.  Host: So Ned, building onto Stu's summary of Artemis I, and the objectives, and thinking about from the production aspect here, just what went into the design and build of Artemis I, let's compare that to Artemis II and the objectives of that, of that mission. After we complete this one next year, or I guess by the time this podcast released this year, 2022, how will that, how will the Artemis II objectives compare, and then building onto that, how does that change in the production of Orion, meaning, what has been added to that vehicle to add on to new test objectives?  Ned Penley: Yeah. Sure. Well, let's see. As Stu described, you know, the Artemis I is really a test of the systems of the spacecraft in making sure that the spacecraft systems all work, work together. One thing that we don't have on Artemis I is crew. We're flying it uncrewed. We want to test that heat shield before we put crew on it, make sure that all that works as designed. And so, then Artemis II then becomes really the first opportunity to put crew on the spacecraft. So we are finishing the, we call it the ECLSS system, the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems. There's some systems that we don't need on Artemis I because there's no crew, things that, that exactly support the crew, like for breathing and just living onboard. So we're going to finish those and put those on the Artemis II spacecraft, and then we launch the crew and the big test there is to, to make sure that those things function as designed, and that the crew, we can safely deliver the crew to the Moon, or orbit the Moon, and then return.  Host: Very critical components to add to that spacecraft. And Stu, I'll go real quickly to Artemis III for a second: any other changes and additions, or anything that you have to think about in terms of the production of that vehicle to get ready for new objectives for Artemis 3?  Stu McClung: There's the biggest thing that'll come in on Artemis III is we will add in our rendezvous and docking capability. As you know, we rendezvous and dock -- not we -- but there's rendezvous and docking going on to space station in low-Earth orbit today. As we start building up the Gateway, Orion will end up, we'll have the requirement to rendezvous and dock with the Gateway or with – with other vehicles that are in the lunar vicinity. And so, as we've been developing the vehicle and balancing out what we want to do on each mission, the next big addition to the Artemis III mission will be our docking system, rendezvous and docking system. That system's being developed right now, leveraging off of a lot of past history that the agency has from docking to ISS, and developing those systems, testing them on the ground, and so we'll bring that onboard. And then depending on, you know, we'll fly Artemis, every time you fly, you learn something, right? And so, when we fly Artemis I in the spring, and if we learn something, if we see something in the performance that, the judgement is really needs to be blended into Artemis III, that's part of our, that’s part of our whole design process, right? I'll get an engineer that'll come to Ned and say, hey, I saw this, and I really need to make this change, and then we'll start the debate about, Ned's going to ask how much it's going to cost, because that's one of his roles. And we'll start that iterative process of, I learned this, is it important enough that I bring it on to Artemis III? Can I wait for Artemis IV, right? What's the lead time for it? And so that whole iteration process. But the one big obvious addition to Artemis III will be rendezvous and docking with the elements of the Gateway program.  Host: Very, very important and very exciting. Seems like there's modifications built along the way, based on things that we're learning, which is very important. I think it's also very exciting, Stu, that when we're talking about some of these missions' objectives, these missions are years away but we're already planning for them right now, and in fact, we're building Orion to enable them. And so, there's Artemis I, II, III, and even I think early fabrication of Artemis IV. You guys are well-prepared, planning well in advance, to make these missions work. So take us through where each of these capsules are, from Artemis I through IV.  Stu McClung: OK. Yes, Artemis I, like Ned pointed out, Artemis I, we're stacked, we're on top of the SLS;  in a sense, Artemis I, the Orion, is done. We're ready to fly as soon as we finish the integrated testing with the SLS. We're ready to go. Artemis II, both the crew module and the European service module are in the assembly facility, they're down at Kennedy Space Center in the O&C (Operations and Checkout), going through their parallel processing and testing, and they'll be brought together in a number of months, and then integrated together as we keep building out towards that next mission. The Artemis III pressure vessel was just finished at the Lockheed facility down near New Orleans at Michoud. It's been delivered to Kennedy, and so we've got Artemis II and III vehicles in the same building, it's just in different stages of production. And there are components coming in from all across the country, like I mentioned earlier, headed to Kennedy to start populating, you know, both the Artemis II and the Artemis III vehicles. And we've just -- I've seen some early pictures of some of the primary structure being machined for the Artemis IV pressure vessel. Some of the, like, as you mentioned, right, some of these, there's lead time. You've got to get in the queue with various suppliers. And so, we've got, you know, between structural elements either being forged or in machine shops, or I'm off buying connectors, one of us is off buying connectors or circuit cards for, you know, for a computer for the Artemis IV vehicle. But yes, so things are going. We got parts being fabbed all across, all across the globe to support this.  Ned Penley: Just to follow on, if I could just follow on, Stu --  Host: Yeah.  Ned Penley: -- with that. You know, I was down at the Kennedy Space Center, so you know, it’s been a few weeks ago. And they took us over to the Vehicle Assembly Building where we see the rocket being stacked up. And there's the Orion Artemis I vehicle, and then you go over to the O&C building, the Operations and Checkout building, that's the building where we're actually fabricating the other spacecraft, and you know, here's Artemis II, and it's all, you know, almost, you know, it really looks like a spacecraft. It, you know, just getting all put together, welded, and wires getting in, and all the avionic parts are getting in, and they're working, it's really starting to take shape as a spacecraft, you look at it and wow, that's getting close. And then, here's some Artemis III parts, and it just sent chills up my spine that, wow, this is really cool. It's starting to be like a regular assembly, and I think that's really cool. It's kind of where we're shooting for so where we can do this in a regular, consistent basis.  Host: Makes it real, right? You're looking at the numbers, you're on the phone, everything is remote, making sure all the pieces are flowing where they need to, but then when you actually see it in person, you know, all your work is there in a physical thing, and you're looking at it, you're looking at all the hard work that everyone put together, sounds like from all over, to make it happen. And it really takes a team, doesn't it Ned? Like, when you're working this, and when you see, see these vehicles, this is the result of working with -- like you were mentioning earlier, working with international partners, working with contractors and suppliers from all over the globe, thinking about those relationships and maintaining those, you know, what has to really go into those relationships, and make sure the requirements are clear, so that you can get to a moment where you're looking at these, the actual hardware, and you're realizing all of the work being brought together into a final product. What is it like with the relationships with partners and contractors?  Ned Penley: Yeah. It's pretty cool, you know. I was thinking about your comment made me think of, you know, the early stages, that PDR kind of stage, the Preliminary Design Review kind of stage, we're looking at drawings, you know, requirements; how are you going to get your drawings done, and you know, when is all this going to get done, how are we going to get it all fashioned and stuff? And I remember looking at, you know, we call them burn-down curves that, that where you can show that you can get all those drawings done, and we have great debates about, you know, how fast we can do those things and stuff. And it's pretty cool, looking back now and saying, wow, we did it. You know? Here's a spacecraft that's totally integrated, sitting on a rocket. That's pretty cool, and as you mentioned, yeah, it takes everybody, you know? I mean, there's parts suppliers throughout the states, and everybody's got a little piece of that. They're making this piece and then they send it off, and it goes down to Kennedy Space Center, we put it together. I think there's a lot of the nation that really feels the ownership of this. It's not just a NASA thing, it's like there's, there’s all the way down to mom and pop shops that are, you know, turning something on a lathe or something. I think that's pretty cool that they send that part off and it gets integrated in, and off it goes. It's part of Orion. It's cool.  Host: We're so close to actually flying this, too, and that's just really the beginning as you guys were mentioning, especially for Artemis 1. This is really to just, I think Stu, you were the one that mentioned it's like the final dress rehearsal, the final test run, to make sure that everything's working before we start getting it ready to put humans on. And I know that's a pretty big step, right, to go from, to go from that test to the next one, where humans are onboard. Both of you are mentioning that the Artemis II capsule is there in the Operations and Checkout building in, in Kennedy, but, and then Stu, I think it was you that was mentioning that, yes, we have some, we have some requirements that are there to make sure we're doing all of the right things, but there's also some times built in between those two missions to say, what did we learn from Artemis I that we can apply to Artemis II? How is that being factored into the design, when it seems like you're already so far ahead, how is that being factored into the rest of the production process for Artemis II?  Stu McClung: One of the things I've always found, one of the strengths of the program, is we will use parts of the vehicle, reuse some aspects, but not all of it. And then, so we've got to continue this production line. So as it gives us the opportunity that as we fly and learn, we can assess and judge, and you're right, a lot of these parts have already been built. We have a very rigorous review process to compare test, flight results ahead of the next flight, and say alright, is there something that I learned on this first flight that says this is a mandatory thing I need to work in, and if it is you adjust, you know? And you figure out what it takes to adjust it in. If it's not mandatory, then you look at it and say, man, I looked at something, and I saw some data that says I can really, I can make this thing fly just a little, this much better, or make it this much safer, or I learned that, man, I don't need quite as much protection here as I thought, and I can perhaps save downstream production costs. And so, the, the flight process includes a data review process that just feeds into the upcoming missions. And sort of allows you to on-ramp technology upgrades or repairs as you see fit. Or you say, you know what? Man, this computer worked way smoother than I thought, and I'm just going to keep using it, and you know, I can, I can save Ned some money and defer buying some new computers, right? And spread that out, right? And so, it's -- we had the – it’s fortunate in the sense that we have a vehicle that has a sustained production line that gives us that capability to on-ramp changes when we see fit.  Host: Now this is not the first -- sorry to interrupt, but this is not the first time that you're going to be doing this, right, to learn something from one mission and apply it to the next? That already happened for, I think it was Stu actually, that mentioned Exploration Flight Test 1 in December of 2014. There was already stuff that was learned from that mission that's being applied to Artemis I, and even Artemis II. Is that right, Ned?  Ned Penley: Yeah. You know, we've had the Exploration Flight Test number 1  was December of 201[4], but you know, our testing is a lot more extensive than that, even. We've had several flights. We had Pad Abort 1 launch in May of 2010; that was where we tested the abort capability, you know, if something untoward were to happen on the launch pad, you have to fly the crew to safety. We used that launch abort system to pull them off the top of the rocket, and up high enough that we can deploy the chutes and can return the crew safely. And we did that test. And so that contributed to the whole learning process. And then EFT-1, it was great: we put that on a big Delta rocket, and flew it up into a high-altitude orbit, and returned, returned the spacecraft and tested the heat shield. And then the Ascent Abort Test 2 launched in July of 2019. That was pretty cool where, again, this abort capability you've got to test, and know when you're flying if there's something untoward that happens, you need to get the crew to safety, again, you use this launch abort system. But it's pretty tricky in that dynamic environment of flight, and you have to test that launch abort system. And we did that. So all of those have contributed to the whole learning of how, how you fly, how you design this rocket, how you fly this rocket, and fly this spacecraft on the rocket. And then one other key test that we will do before Artemis II is when Artemis I comes back, we actually take that spacecraft, the return spacecraft, and we do vibration testing on it, more vibration testing on it, so if that launch abort capability is ever used that we're absolutely 100% certain that it will survive that environment. So all those things contribute to our, our learning curve, if you will.  Host: Super important, right -- it's not just the one test, it's all of these different tests together that give you the confidence going forward and the ability to learn so much that gets applied to future missions, to learn even more. Thinking about some of the things coming up, Ned, I'll go to you for this, this last question, and then over to Stu as well, but there's so much to look forward to right now: we have the Artemis I, Artemis II we're actually going to fly crew, and we're going to see crew around the Moon, and there's so much progress already where we have capsules built, we have good relationships with partners and suppliers. What excites you the most thinking about Artemis and this whole, this whole endeavor that we're embarking on to return humans to the Moon?  Ned Penley: Yeah. It's all really exciting. It's so cool. I am super-proud to, to be just a part of this endeavor. Like I said, you know, when you go to the Kennedy Space Center, you see all that stuff stacked up. It's like that's what we've worked so hard for, to make sure it's all going to work and going to happen, and here it is happening. I'm looking forward to that Artemis I launch, looking forward to Artemis II, a successful flight with that. You know, I grew up in the, in the time of Apollo. I was a little boy and I was, you know, listening to Neil Armstrong step on the Moon; that was what absolutely motivated me to, to do this work. And I think it's so cool to just be a part of it. I'm so glad to be a part of it, have my little piece. And to see it all coming together is just really exciting.  Host: Wonderful. Stu, same question to you.  Stu McClung: It's interesting. Very similar emotions that Ned has, it's, I find it really, to be a really personal hook to get to build, design and help build vehicles that the crew are going to fly. You know, you'll end up in a case where some of these crew end up being really good friends. I remember my kid being on swim team with other astronauts’ [kids’] swim team. And it puts a different, different aspect to the importance of the mission. And so, yeah, I was, as Ned was talking, I think I, having worked parachutes and entry systems for a long time, that for both missions, when I see three good chutes and a nice, soft landing off the coast, I'm really looking forward to that, right? Because we got them out, both times we got them out there, got the mission done, and got everybody back home. And you know, then it's time to move on to the next one. I'll have my Fitbit on, and I'll be curious to see what my pulse does.  Host: [laughter] Unbelievable. Very personal. A lot of hard work that went into this, and you can both tell you're both passionate about this work, and it's important to, to the nation, really. I think, Ned, it was you who said there's so many, so many people that have their fingerprints in this from all over the U.S. and the world, really, that it is, I can see where that personal connection comes from, and it's wonderful to hear from you both. So Ned and Stu, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast and bringing us a better understanding of just what it takes to build an Orion, and to share some of the progress that's -- it's just unbelievable how much progress we've made, and we're coming up on these missions very soon. It's going to be a very exciting year. So, so to you both, thank you for coming on. Take care.  Stu McClung: Thanks a lot!  Ned Penley: Thanks for having me.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I really enjoyed having Ned and Stu on to talk about the Orion spacecraft and how to build it. They were both so excited to talk about all the progress, and there has been some significant progress for a lot of Orion spacecraft. I couldn't believe it. I hope you got excited as much as I did.

            "description": "The dusty side of the Sword of Orion is illuminated in this striking infrared image from the European Space Agency's Hershel Space Observatory.  This immense nebula is the closest large region of star formation, situated about 1,500 light years away in the constellation of Orion. The parts that are easily observed in visible light, known alternatively as the Orion Nebula or Messier 42, correspond to the light blue regions. This is the glow from the warmest dust, illuminated by clusters of hot stars that have only recently been born in this chaotic region.  The red spine of material running from corner to corner reveals colder, denser filaments of dust and gas that are scattered throughout the Orion nebula. In visible light this would be a dark, opaque feature, hiding the reservoir of material from which stars have recently formed and will continue to form in the future.  Herschel data from the PACS instrument observations, at wavelengths of 100 and 160 microns, is displayed in blue and green, respectively, while SPIRE 250-micron data is shown in red.  Within the inset image, the emission from ionized carbon atoms (C+), overlaid in yellow, was isolated and mapped out from spectrographic data obtained by the HIFI instrument.  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21073"

            "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 35: A Ride in Orion.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So in this podcast we bring in the experts -- NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts -- all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today we're talking about NASA's deep space humans capsule, Orion.  Orion will take us outside low-earth orbit, well beyond the International Space Station.  To prepare Orion to take us to deep space, we have folks here at the Johnson Space Center working on development and testing of every stage of flight, one of whom is Jeff Fox, chief engineer of the Rapid Prototype Lab at the Johnson Space Center, here to tell us all about Orion and how the Rapid Prototype Lab plays a role in its success.  We talked about some of the testing that's been happening for Orion, and Jeff brings us the actual audio from those tests to experience during this episode.  It really felt like we were taking a ride on Orion.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Jeff Fox.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Thanks a lot for coming today to talk about kind of Orion.  And you are the chief engineer of the Rapid Prototype Lab; is that right?    Jeff Fox: That's correct.  And thanks for having me.  I'm excited to be here and talk about -- talk to you today.    Host: Fantastic.  All right.  Well, we're going to kind of get into the Rapid Prototype Lab.  And I'm really excited for this episode because the whole idea of that lab is you can kind of sit down and sort of experience some of these test flights that we've done.  And you have audio recordings of that that you brought in.  And we'll kind of go through those and you, the listener can actually sit back and kind of -- kind of experience what it's like inside these test runs inside of Orion.  And Jeff's going to kind of guide us through that experience [Laughs].    Jeff Fox: Yes.  It's very exciting.  We're going to take you through a launch, an entry, and a pad abort like when you're trying to get away from the rocket if it's not performing well on a launch and your little escape rocket on top.  I think you'll really find it interesting.    Host: Yeah, this is really going to be cool.  So let's kind of set the scene a little bit.  We've done a couple episodes on Orion itself, but if we can just start with the basics of what is this vehicle that we're going to be on?  Because all of these tests are different parts of Orion, but this vehicle Orion, what is it?    Jeff Fox: Well, obviously it's a capsule.  People have seen it.  You know, it has a similar shape to Apollo, only it has four people in it.  It's wider at the bottom.  So whereas Apollo was on the order of 3.9 meters, Orion is 5 meters.  So it's quite a bit bigger in the interior.  It also has a heat shield that's unique.  And it's the largest one that we've tested to date.  So that's a real unique factor.  And it has a lot of newer electronics in it.  And you don't have as many physical switches.  Everything is done under a glass and computer displays, much like everybody's used to seeing on their laptop and video games.  But so all those technologies and all that's been learned over the many years since Apollo [inaudible] all try to take advantage of the ones that help us and use the ones that are reliable and cost-effective and that will get the job done.    Host: Exactly.  Okay, cool.  So you got this capsule.  And this capsule is going to bring us further than we've gone before, right?  And then we're going to be focusing NASA -- the objective is to go and explore the solar system and sort of establish this -- this space in the low-earth orbit for commercial industries to come and take over; is that right?    Jeff Fox: The goal is to have the commercial crew vehicles, you know, take up the space in low-earth orbit where Shuttle and Station have been the ones primarily and Soyuz and other visiting vehicles, but we're trying to move beyond that.  So it takes a bigger rocket, it takes different -- it's different challenges to do that.  Because whether we go to the moon, go to a gateway that's somewhere between the moon and the Earth, go to Mars, you're going to have to have a vehicle that can get you out of earth orbit.  You're going to have to have a vehicle, Orion the capsule, that can get you safely back into the atmosphere and back to Earth after these missions.  These missions can be longer.  They can be days or weeks, it could be months or years.  Now, we don't want anybody to think that you're going it live in that little, tiny capsule for years and years -- well, obviously you're not.  For the upcoming missions it's maybe a week or two.  You know, you're dealing with days or weeks.  That may be okay.  But if you're going to Mars or you're going somewhere for a long time, you're going to have to dock to a larger habitable volume.   You know, something -- a bigger canister, if you will, where you can live and do other things.  And then you'll transition back into Orion as your vehicle to get you back to Earth when the time is right.    Host: Exactly.  And we're taking these steps to get to that point, just one step at a time, kind of developing this vehicle.  We're building right now the vehicle for EM-1, I believe.  But we've actually done a test in the past, EFT-1, right?  That was our first test flight of Orion.    Jeff Fox: That's correct.  EFT-1 stands for Exploration Flight Test 1.  It was actually launched on a different booster than we're going to use for our NASA missions.  It was on a Delta IV heavy.  But that rocket got us to the speed and altitude conditions around the Earth that we needed because what we really wanted to do was test the heat shield, structure, recovery systems, those types of things.  You know?  And we did that.  The vehicle actually went up to 20,000 miles an hour, which is the faster any vehicle -- manned-type vehicle -- has been since Apollo.  And we're actually going to have to go faster than that to escape Earth orbit when we go to the moon.    Host: That's right.  Because the Delta IV brought us not necessarily around the moon, but brought us kind of in the lunar vicinity and then coming back super fast, right?    Jeff Fox: It was a highly elliptical orbit.  So it was around the Earth but way away from the Earth.    Host: Yes.    Jeff Fox: A very high apogee.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: So, you know, you were coming in, accelerating the Earth, and building up those tremendous speeds so you can test the heat shield and structure.    Host: Yeah.  And that was the mission profile.  You got the heat shield.  You had, you know, these incredible speeds to get to the temperatures in order to test the heat shield.  But then there was the whole sequence of deploying parachutes, too, right?    Jeff Fox: That's right.  You know, you're only as good as all the components that work together.  And if you can't get the chutes out, it's not going to be a good mission.    Host: Exactly.  And you actually got to see that firsthand, didn't you?    Jeff Fox: Yeah, I was very fortunate.  We actually -- what's really unique is you want to be close as you can to this vehicle anytime we're doing tests like this, whether it's parachutes out in the desert in Yuma, Arizona or the spacecraft coming back from space with the EFT-1.  And nominally, the error predictions of all the debris that come off when these parachute come out are very large.  And so you can't approach in a helicopter or thing too close because it's dangerous -- something could hit the rotor, hit the helicopter.  But you want to get close because you want to get good stills and video because it's good for engineering and documentation and great for public affairs to share the imagery.  But you have to have a way to do that.  So a system was developed that allowed us to look at the error predictions of these things coming off.  And I was fortunate enough to be deployed aboard ship out at sea for EFT-1, and we flew in the Navy Seahawk out at altitude about 6,000 feet out over the Pacific Ocean.  And we were flying with the Navy and using their cameras to image the vehicle that was coming back in from space.   I think we picked it up somewhere around 70,000 feet it.  It looked like a star on infrared, then we switched it to the live video.  We kept the video trained on it.  We were able to make all the timing calls for our photographs and videographers onboard the helicopter and follow the vehicle basically down to splashdown.  So it was an honor, very exciting time.    Host: That's incredible.  So were you piloting, or were you taking the images, or monitoring the instruments?    Jeff Fox: Well, it's a whole team.  The Navy was doing the piloting.  And then we had a mostly NASA -- combined NASA contractor team in the back of the aircraft either taking pictures, keeping track of the timeline and letting people know what's happening, or like myself, operating a tool we called the debris tool.  So we make sure we're staying in the places that are safe to fly in -- there's no hazardous debris in those areas.    Host: Yeah.  And then kind of tracking it.  Did you actually see it come down?    Jeff Fox: I was.  Usually you're real focused.  This is a great question.  You're so intent you don't want to screw up, right?  Everybody's looking at you, you put all this into it, you don't want to miss the money shot.  Right?  So you're looking at your screen, but you realize history's going on.  I did get a quick peek out the right-side window and I could see the vehicle coming down.  And I could see it splashdown.  But your main thing is the safety of the helicopter and everybody on board and allow us to collect that imagery so the engineers and others can use it later.    Host: Awesome.  All right.  So that was our first step on this future vehicle that's going to take us deeper into space.  But really, your job title is the chief engineer of the Rapid Prototype Lab, right?  So what's that, what's the Rapid Prototype Lab?    Jeff Fox: So it's kind of a generic-sounding name.  It's a name that's stuck.  The lab's actually been around for over ten years.  It belongs to the crew office, CB, at NASA.  The whole purpose of it is you have a lot of knowledge with test pilots and all the seasoned crew that have been aboard all these spacecrafts, and they have a lot of knowledge about how to operate a vehicle.  And that knowledge can be -- we want to leverage it.  And what our lab does is we are actually in the critical path of building the displays that will be used to control the Orion vehicle in all flight phases -- the launch phases, the orbit phases, the entry phases.  So there's roughly 70 of these displays -- software displays that the crew will use to interact with.  Well, the crew is very involved in design of what the content of those displays are.  And so our lab is charged with building these prototypes and these displays, describing how they work, bringing the crew into simulators that we've built to test out these displays, find if there's issues with them that we need to correct.   And this is not something new.  We're doing it for Orion, but we've also did it in Shuttle and for other vehicles, like the X-38 that we've tested in the past.  So it's really a real resource, you know, to ensure we've got a spacecraft that the crew can interface with.  Because that's your primary control, is through those displays.    Host: And that's it, is to -- I guess, rapid prototype means you kind of use the resources you have to kinds of put this together.  \"All right, what can we create to simulate this pilot, this experience, and this cockpit,\" I guess?    Jeff Fox: Yes.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And I'm saying, again, getting back to the name Rapid Prototyping Lab, it's really of the crew interfaces.    Host: I see.    Jeff Fox: So that's kind of a generic name, but that's what we're really doing.  In this case the displays.  So that's really your whole interface to this vehicle.  You know, without that, you know, you're kind of along for the ride.  But you may need manual intervention.  You want to follow what the automation's doing at times.  There's a whole host of reasons that you want to see data and know what's going on with your vehicle.  And you may go on missions that are a long time delay before somebody can talk to you.  Well, I may have to go in there and do things and I can't wait for the ground.  So we need to try to think of those things and we work with teams of the crew and human engineering, and flight operations, mission control, flight controllers.  So together we all come up with these concepts and test them with the crew and, you know, take advantage of all that experience -- decades, centuries of experience when you add it all up.    Host: There you go.  Yeah, you're right, this is a place where all of this knowledge comes together to create this beautiful thing that eventually is going to go in a real vehicle and the procedures are going to be implemented in real space flight.    Jeff Fox: That's the most exciting part for us, knowing that for -- you know, we build these vehicles maybe what, once every 30 years?  You know, this has been my short experience.  And they can last that long, you know, or longer and just be able to be part of even a couple displays or actually [inaudible] the crew is using and you test it is really exciting.    Host: Oh, yeah.  And so this is the reason that I really wanted you to come in, is you gave us a tour of this Rapid Prototype Lab and we actually got to sit back and you played this experience of Exploration Flight Test 1, of EFT-1.  And it truly felt like I was there.  I felt like I was inside.  So what are you using this test for, this footage, the lab specifically for EFT-1?    Jeff Fox: A couple things.  One, it certainly is one of the most popular tours around [Laughs].  We get a lot of requests.  I think we've had he have been from the center director to the head of -- the administrator of NASA on down.    Host: Oh, wow.    Jeff Fox: To different authors, and dignitaries, and all kinds of personnel.  Because it's fun.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: But it's not just a simulation.  The difference with this is I'd say it's more like a recreation.  Because we've actually taken the real audio and video off of the EFT-1 test flight like you talked about.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And the way we did that was although there was no crew on it for that first launch, we gathered all the data we mentioned about, we came back 20 miles an hour, tested the heat shield.  But there was a microphone inside of the crew cabin.  And it's located near where the crew's head is.  So we had the idea if we got this audio, we could certainly replicate the audio during the different mission phases -- the launch, the entry, those kind of things.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And then we said well, you know what?  Not only do we have the audio, we've got the video because there's different cameras pointed out the different windows.  And okay, well, I bet we can sync up the audio and the video together.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And we had an idea we were going to build a simulator that you can lay on your back.  And in fact, the particular simulator we're repurposing was flown on the zero-gravity plane that does a big parabolic arc in the sky.  As we were testing things early on in the program, we repurposed that and pumped the audio and the video into that.  You lay out your back, you look out the windows.  We actually are proud of the fact that we did it very cost-effectively, too, because we repurposed older seats that Orion wasn't using.  We went to Home Depot and bought a screen and created a screen over the windows that you lay down and look out -- the regular Orion windows which are in our mock-up.    Host: Cool.    Jeff Fox: We used a projector that was not being used for anything else.  And, you know, now we have a way to recreate the launch, the landing, and the pad abort, which we'll probably talk about in a little bit.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: Not only can we recreate it and it's the fun part, but we've actually used that audio/video and tied it in with data from the real mission and put the crew in there and let them actually practice manually deploying parachutes, for example, or working malfunctions.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Jeff Fox: And not only that, that simulator's been tied to a very what we call a mini-mission control room with flight controllers, a handful of them where we can flow that same simulation data, talk on the different intercom system, and it's just like a real flight -- a simulation where you have the mission control involved with the crew, using this audio, video, and different data.  And you get a feel for what it's like to really be on the vehicle.  We can really learn how good are these displays working and what works well.  Because it's a brand new system.  We need to test these things.    Host: All right.  So I mean, the fact that you had audio and video on EFT-1, were you advocating for that or was that part of the mission design?    Jeff Fox: Part of the mission design.    Host: I see.    Jeff Fox: We just said, \"Hey, it's there, let's see what we can do with it.\"    Host: Yes.    Jeff Fox: Again, hence the name Rapid Prototyping Lab, RPL, it doesn't always cost a lot to try these different concepts.  So we're fortunate that we were able to prototype these things.  And we need to do things.  You they, sometimes it doesn't have to be a perfect production model to test things and find out if you're on the right path.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: So we could build something like this recreation of EFT-1.    Host: Fantastic.  Well, I'm ready to ride on it.  You want to take us through?    Jeff Fox: I'm ready.  I never get tired of it.  I've done it over 100 times and never, never tire of it.    Host: Oh, man.  I'm very excited.  Okay, all right.  So the first one, I think, why don't we start with launch?  Because I feel like that's the first thing you think about -- the first part of EFT-1.  So I wanted to take us through the first three minutes.  And there's a good reason for that.  What's happening on the first three minutes of launch?    Jeff Fox: Well, of course, you're lighting the engines for the first time.  You're close to the ground.  You know, that's what -- if you were standing in the audience, you'd see the big flame.  And a number of seconds later, you hear the audio, the sound coming in.  Well, interesting thing from the perspective of the crew, you're getting the microphone on board.  So it's pretty loud.  You're going to really hear that when you first launch.  And the other thing about that is the sound is right there, it's all going into the ground, it's reflecting back up onto you and the structure.  And so it's pretty rowdy for those first several seconds.  And then as you move away from the ground and that structure, it quiets down a little bit because you're not getting the sound of the rocket and the reflected sound and all that.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And as you're moving up through the atmosphere, again, it quiets down a little bit more.  But then you start to pick up more speed.  And as some of you even remember back in Shuttle, you remember those calls like max Q, and things like that, maximum dynamic pressure, fancy words for the vehicle's moving very quickly through dense air and the aeroforces on the vehicle, you can transmit some more sound on the vehicle, and you can kind of hear the sound rise a little bit as you're going in those regimes.  And then as you go faster but you get through much thinner air, the sound will taper off and then eventually it will be fairly quiet as you're ascending through the atmosphere.    Host: Exactly.  And then eventually it's going to get to a point where you're not going to really hear anything until things start clicking and deploying and stuff, right?    Jeff Fox: It's very quiet.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: It's much quieter.  I mean, you're going to notice something's going on.  Obviously you're going to feel a rumble.  That's the other nice thing about our simulators, we actually play back some vibration, you know, from those recorded microphones into the seat.  So not only are you looking at the audio and video, you're feeling the seat move.    Host: Yes.    Jeff Fox: So you really feel like it's a, I guess, 3D experience, if you will [Laughs].  So you know, you got the motion typical, like, home theatre-type of seat shakers.    Host: All right.  All right.  Well, if you have a home theatre seat shaker, this is the time to plug it in for this podcast.  Because we're going to take you through the first three minutes of launch.  And like you said, it's going to sort of -- it will be loud at first, and then it will sort of quiet down after you get to maximum dynamic pressure.  And then it starts getting louder again, and then as you kind of escape the atmosphere, the molecules, you're not pushing up against anything and it gets quieter and quieter and quieter until nothing.    Jeff Fox: That's right.    Host: Awesome.  All right, here we go.  Take us through the ride.     [ Rockets firing ]    Okay, awesome.  That was pretty cool.  All right.  So that was the first part.  And so that's the launch.  Then through the mission profile it goes -- what, it goes around the Earth, and then that's when it does the large apogee?  Is that kind of what happens on EFT-1?    Jeff Fox: Yeah.  Well, the bottom line is it's a couple orbit --    Host: Couple orbit.    Jeff Fox: -- mission, but you're getting -- your whole objective is to get a very high apogee and create the entry speeds that are needed to test the heat shield properly.    Host: Yes.    Jeff Fox: You know, it's one thing to test it in low-earth orbit at 17,500 miles an hour, but you have to do -- generate a different type of trajectory and performance profile in order to generate a 20,000-mile-an-hour entry to create the heat, the 4,000-degree roughly heating that you're going to get on the heat shield to find out if that and the structure will survive all that.  So.    Host: Exactly, exactly.  And, you know, 2,500 miles an hour is not just small, like, boost, you know?  That's significant.  So --    Jeff Fox: 20,000 miles an hour.    Host: Right.  I mean, 2,500 extra miles an hour.    Jeff Fox: Oh, 2,500 extra miles an hour?  That's correct.  That's exactly right.    Host: Yeah.  So generating that is no small feat.  So that's where this next part comes in.  And that's the entry sequence, right?    Jeff Fox: Right.    Host: So we've kind of split this up into a couple different segments.  First is you're starting to enter the atmosphere and there's -- that's when the heat is starting to build up and you're getting this plasma; what's happening there?    Jeff Fox: Well, you're basically now, you know, if you think about the ascent, you were speeding through the atmosphere is getting quieter.  Now you're at your maximum speed of 20,000 miles an hour.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: As you come into what we call entry interface at probably 400,000 feet, 80 miles up roughly, you start running into enough air fast enough that you're creating this heat and this plasma around the vehicle, around the heat shield and you're generating these maximum temperatures in the 4,000-degree range in order to test your heat shield.  And as you're riding in there, you can actually see the plasma going by the window; you hear the jets fire; you see the plasma interrupted and moving outside the window.    Host: Whoa.    Jeff Fox: It's quite a sight.  So you're hearing it, you're seeing it.  You know, you're feeling the jet fires of the little attitude control jets to either stabilize you or change your attitude.  So it's quite a ride.    Host: All right.  Okay.  So I think that video has to be available somewhere, like, on YouTube or NASA.gov or something like that.    Jeff Fox: I know there are vehicles -- there are videos I've seen post the flight, which was back in December of '14.    Host: Yes.    Jeff Fox: Some of them, I think they are the same views, but they may be either set to NASA narration or music.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jeff Fox: What we did is we stripped all that out because we just wanted it like it would have been had the crew been in it.    Host: Yes.    Jeff Fox: It was a crew experience.  So it's just audio from the perspective of the crew inside the cabin and video out the window.    Host: Cool.  All right.  So let's go into that.  Let's play -- it's about 30 -- maybe 30 seconds, maybe a minute.  You're going to hear the plasma start to build.  And it's kind of like a white noise almost kind of noise?    Jeff Fox: Yeah.    Host: And then you'll hear these thumps.  And that's the jet firings as it's changing attitude.    Jeff Fox: Right, exactly.    [ Rockets firing ]    Host: All right.  Awesome.  All right.  So the next part is there's this kind of a gap up until the next loud sound you hear is the chute, when the chute start coming out, right?    Jeff Fox: Yeah.  Actually, the first thing happens, there's a cover protecting all that, the chute compartment on the top.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: You wouldn't want that just exposed to anything before you're ready for it to come out.  So the first thing that's going to happen is that cover, the fore bay, the FBC will jettison.  You'll here a pyrotechnics fires and you'll hear that thing come off.  You'll see it actually go by out the window.  So that's kind of interesting to see it fly off.  And that's followed very quickly by the drove chute.  There's two drove chute that are about 23 feet in diameter.  And what you're doing there is you're trying to put those out to slow and ensure the vehicle's in a stable configuration because you don't want to put out your next set of parachutes until you've done that.  And so, you know, certain amount of time later, your main parachutes will come out.  There's three of those.  Each one of those is about 115-foot in diameter.  Again, you'll hear another loud pyrotechnics sound because you have mortars that are firing that are deploying these parachute.  The good thing about these parachute is you got three.  So any two of them you can have a safe landing.  That's a good thing.  You got some redundancy.    Host: All right, that's awesome.  Okay.  So let's play that, let's play the chute deployment sequence.  It's about 30-ish seconds long, so let's go through there.     [ Orion sounds ]    Okay, awesome.  So those main chute are deploying.  Now you're coasting on those for a couple minutes, right?    Jeff Fox: Yeah, that's right.    Host: And then so now you're going down and you're splashing.  And the EFT-1 happened in the -- it splashed down in the Pacific Ocean?    Jeff Fox: That's correct.    Host: Okay.  So then now this is the last part we're going to play, is the actual splashdown.  So I think you start off by hearing a couple thumps, right?  And those are the jets are firing for orientation?    Jeff Fox: Yeah, there's some jets firing.  In that particular mission we were trying to keep the -- basically the spinal axis of the astronaut, if you will, from head to toe pointing in the direction that we're moving so that when you splashdown, the loads that you take, the G forces that you take, kinds of spread them out nice and evenly across your body.    Host: Ah.    Jeff Fox: So you're kind of hearing maybe [inaudible] these jets fire to try to hold that position.  And then you'll hear the splashdown.  And it's really great in the video, unfortunately folks can't see it, but you see the water come up over the windows.    Host: Oh, cool.    Jeff Fox: And then you sit there for a few more seconds and then you hear another pyrotechnic booming sound.  And that's the risers that are connected to the parachutes cutting them away.  Because you want to get yourself away from those.    Host: That's right.  Yeah.  You don't want them to be pulling you all over the place.    Jeff Fox: That's right.    Host: Okay, cool.  So that's only a couple seconds here.  So we'll go through the jets firing and the splashdown all the way to cutting those risers.     [ Orion sounds ]    All right, very cool.  So there it is.  There's your ride on Orion.  It's launching and then landing in that whole sequence there.  So the last part that I really wanted to experience was the pad abort test that we did I think it was back in 2010?  And that was Pad Abort 1.  It's very quick, isn't it?    Jeff Fox: Yeah, it's real quick.  Actually, that was done down out at White Sands, New Mexico, you know, just sitting on a capsule with a booster -- the abort rocket's on top of it emulating an escape from the launch pad.  You know, if you were sitting out there and this crew was on this big, massive rocket and there wasn't time to jump out and run down a slide wire and slide to safety, you might have to light that little rocket off.  And it would separate at the bottom of the capsule and pull the capsule away.  So that was -- the way we emulated that out at White Sands is we put, again, that capsule on a concrete pad, had the escape rocket on top, and then fired that rocket to test it.    Host: That's right.  And this -- the whole idea of a pad abort is this thing is supposed to be escaping from a failed vehicle.  So it's -- everything happens so fast.  And you're probably feeling a lot of G's, right?    Jeff Fox: That's correct.  Whether you're escaping on the launch pad or you're escaping when you're at altitude, that little rocket has a big task.  It has to accelerate your 20,000-pound roughly capsule away from a giant, most powerful rocket ever built that's behind you that may be chasing you.    Host: [Laughs] Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And you may be pushing through a thick part of the atmosphere.  So not only are you trying to push through the atmosphere, you're trying to get out of the way of maybe a rocket that's coming apart at the booster below you.  So I've got to have a really high-accelerating little escape rocket to get me out of harm's way.  So when this motor fires, it's only for a few seconds and those G's build up very quickly.  But they spike real quickly and come down real quickly because, you know, if you were on those too long, you can injure yourself.    Host: Yeah, that's right.  I mean, feeling that on your -- it's kind of spread out throughout your whole body, I can't even imagine what that feels like.    Jeff Fox: That's interesting you say that.  I kind of segue into my dad, Mike Fox actually back in the mid '60s he was the lead subject in the centrifuge.  And think of a centrifuge as something that swings around and in this case it was him and his other Navy test subjects back in the mid '60s.  And they were riding several of the Apollo abort profiles.  And those were in the 12- to 16-G range.  In fact, my dad rode one up.  He still holds a record at JSC at 16 G's.    Host: Whoa.    Jeff Fox: And if you want to get an idea of what that's like, you could go out to your garage and jack your car up and get in the center of it and let it down on your chest.  If you're 200 pounds and you multiply that by 16, that's 3,200 pounds, so --    Host: Whoa.    Jeff Fox: -- that's what it's like.  Now, obviously no body can take that body -- not somebody but your physical body can take that --    Host: Right.    Jeff Fox: -- for very long.  So the G comes on very quick.  We're talking fractions of a second or maybe a second.  But it's short but it's intense.  And you can cause bodily injury.  In fact, interesting story, my dad was doing a high-G run and the simulator, that part went well, but the simulator had to be slowed down or abrupt slowdown.  What that did is if you think about swinging around like on an amusement ride, your inner ear and how the fluid in your inner ear can get disturbed if you stop abruptly or move your head and you feel upset something or something?    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: Well, when they stopped the centrifuge and he got out, he didn't feel real well.  And eventually, you know, they observed him, they said, \"Well, you can go home.\"  He had a little hazardous duty badge on for when you ride in the centrifuge because it obviously can be hazardous.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jeff Fox: And he decided, \"Well, you know, they said you could go home.\"  And so he got in his car and drove home.  And, you know, a few minutes into the drive he's getting pulled over.  He sees police behind him.  And he's like, \"Well, geez, I don't know what's wrong.  I haven't done anything.\"  So he pulled over.  And the officer asked him to step out and say, \"Did you know you were weaving all over the road?\"  \"Well, no, sir.  I'm fine.\"  You know?  Of course he's thinking he's fine.    Host: Right.    Jeff Fox: And the officer said, \"We want you to turn around and put your hands on the roof.\"  And so he went to turn around and put his hands on his roof and he fell backwards.  His whole inner ear was -- had everything transposed 180 out to what he thought he was -- the motion he was performing was, like, the opposite.  And so then, you know, police immediately thought, \"Well, you must be drunk.  You have to be drunk.\"  And, of course, he's trying to show him his badge and say no, no, I'm part of the NASA crew.  I was doing this.  And they weren't going to have anything of it.  So they took him to the Baytown jail probably about a half an hour from the Johnson Space Center here.  And, of course, it was in the evening.  And he's trying to get him to understand what's going on.  And so some time later in the evening, one of the desk sergeants or somebody came over and said, \"I want to take another look at this.\"  And so he asked him some more questions.  He looked at the badge and he's like, \"Maybe we've made a terrible mistake.  Maybe you're telling us the truth.\"    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: Bottom line is they wind up saying, \"Yes, we checked it out.  You're good.\"  But the funny thing was is they actually took him out to his car, which was still on the side of the road and let him get in it to go home.  And he still has this condition that maybe he's driving like a drunk even though it's not his fault.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And so he gets in the car, somehow gets home about 3:30 in the morning.  Of course, mom is there.  You know, we're real young at the time, so we don't remember -- maybe six, seven years old.  She says, \"Where are you?  Have you been out?  Have you been out with the guys?  What's been going on here?\"  And he says, \"No, I was doing this high-G centrifuge run and we had an issue.  And this and that and the police, and here I am.\"  And so he was changing clothes, getting ready to go to bed and went to sit down on the bed and fell down -- fell backwards.  And so immediately she's thinking, \"No, you must have been out.  This was some party or something.\"  But he eventually talked to her and explained it.  And everything worked out.    Host: And then she took him right back to jail, huh?    Jeff Fox: Oh, yeah, right [Laughs].  Well, thank goodness he made it back because we did see him again.    Host: Thankfully, absolutely.  Wow.  That's amazing how long that that affected him, how long that his equilibrium was so out of whack.  That's all the way through the middle of the night.    Jeff Fox: You kind of -- where you upset your gyros, you know, you -- literally those little hair follicles and that fluid in your inner ear can really be disturbed.  And they don't necessarily -- you don't just necessarily recover from that immediately [inaudible].    Host: Yeah.  So this pad abort test, this is going to -- you know, you're going to feel the G's, but it's going to do it in a way where the human body isn't going to be so out of whack, right?    Jeff Fox: No, you're not going to stop abruptly like in the centrifuge and that motion.  You're getting the G's from chest to back, you're laying down, looking straight up.  They're onset very quickly.  You know, the whole thrust of the motor is, you know, three to four seconds.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: And you're not at that max G for more than fractions of a second in that peak.  It does peak there and it is uncomfortable.  And it does save your life.  So that's the purpose of it.  You know, if they can bring you back and you have a little bruising, well, then we did our job.    Host: Yes, yes, exactly.  And just another point is you said you're feeling this on your chest and it's being kind of spread evenly throughout your body, but on the motion directly kind of on your chest versus, you know, straight up your spine couldn't handle that, right?  If you were taking those loads.    Jeff Fox: I mean, you'd have a whole other bigger problem.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Jeff Fox: If it was coming from toward your head to your toe or your toes to your head, you would have a lot of other complications.  And so that's not a good orientation to put the body in.    Host: Definitely not.  And that's why they're oriented this way during launch.  So for Pad Abort 1 we're going to take you to that simulation, that audio right now.  It's very loud up front, right?  So I would just be prepared for that, it's going to be real sudden.  But then it's going to be real loud.  And then about 30 seconds in, that's where everything happens and it has to happen super quickly, right?    Jeff Fox: Yes.  So if you think about it, think of two ways of doing an abort.  A pad abort means you're sitting on the pad or you're very close to the ground, right?  So that's one way.  Another way is you've got altitude, you're already in the boost phase of the main booster.  Maybe you're at 10,000 feet, maybe you're at 100,000 feet.  So you have some altitude to work, to deploy parachute and that type of thing.  Well, in this particular one you're going to experience, this pad abort, you're sitting on the ground, remember, out at White Sands, New Mexico.  The capsule's on the ground, the escape rocket was on top.  So you only have a few thousand feet to play with after the thrust of that abort motor is finished.  So as soon as that loud noise is over and tails off, you hear another booming noise and that's the jettison motor to pull the cover off of the vehicle.  Because you have a cover over it to protect it from all the smoke and fire of the main motor, to get you to safety.    Host: That's right, because it's right above you.    Jeff Fox: It's right above you.  But you can't get your parachute out unless you get this cover off.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: So the cover comes off, but because you don't have a lot of altitude, the next thing right away happens is the forward bay cover that we talked about before for the entry that covers the parachute compartment, it comes off followed right away by the drove chutes, followed right away by the main chutes.  You don't have time -- you don't have time to watch everything perfectly come out and be stable.  You just have to get under the parachutes.    Host: That's right.  So everything's happening super fast.  So, again, it's really loud up front.  So just be prepared for that.  And then 30 second in about, that's where everything's going to deploy.     [ Rocket sounds ]    All right, cool.  So that's -- that's pretty much, like, some of the coolest parts about the Rapid Prototype Lab, right, is you got these simulators.  And we just took you through launch, entry, and Pad Abort 1.  And you can actually sit in the Rapid Prototype Lab and feel all of this kind of real time.  You're not just doing the audio, but you're talking about the vibrations, the visuals, all these things, these elements so that the crew can actually learn what they're like.    Jeff Fox: That's right.  It's a good familiarization tool.  If you haven't done it, you can get in there and it will kind of give you an idea.  I think the thing that struck us was how many of those little attitude control jets fire and how much there is really happening there.    Host: Yeah.    Jeff Fox: That's not something you sit around and just think about.  You think of a launch, it's a dull roar and it goes down.  And you don't hear a lot of those things.  But on the entry it's a whole different things, and you're hearing the pyrotechnics fire and seeing the parachute come out through the window.  And totally different experience.  We use that tool along with other simulators to help the crew get familiar with these flight phases or learn how to interface with the vehicle, the displays that we're building.  So it's a great tool.    Host: Exactly.  I'm imagining, like, an emergency situation, too.  Because if you're taking someone through the Rapid Prototype Lab and you know to listen for the thump, thump, thump, thump, you know, if something wasn't going right, you've actually lived it, you've experienced it.  So you can actually report something, \"Hey, maybe something's not going the way that I want or maybe we need to, you know, think about this emergency response scenario because this -- I'm not hearing or experiencing it the way that I experienced it in the Rapid Prototype Lab.\"    Jeff Fox: That's exactly right.    Host: That's awesome.  And I'm sure a lot of these lessons learned are going to be taken on future missions, too.  So where's Orion going next?    Jeff Fox: So the next flight is an unmanned flight, EM-1 here in a few years here.  Now we've got missions that are being defined, you know, in the vicinity of the moon or around the moon.  So that's the next stop, you know, followed it a few years later by a crew potentially doing that same type of flight profile.  And I think as time goes on we're going to get more clarification with our schedule and budgets and direction from the president and Congress.  So, you know, where our next, you know, stops will be.  And so we're excited for that.  We're building the capability right now.  We'll be ready to execute those missions.    Host: That's right.  It's just amazing talking to you and then all of these other Orion experts, you kind of get the whole picture of everything that's going into this, right?  There's so many different elements and so many different people working on all of these different things that help to make this mission successful.  So it's kind of exciting that when you see this -- this thing launch, you know, it just looks like a launch to you.  But then you think about all the work and all the people that worked so hardly and diligently to make this moment possible.  It's kind of -- it's kind of inspiring to see that thing on the launch pad -- or it will be when it finally does.  I'm very excited for it.  Well, Jeff, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today and taking us through the super cool audio experience.  I really truly felt like I was on Orion.  That's the whole purpose -- that's really why I wanted to bring you in, is just I felt it, man.  It's a different experience and you're right, it kind of helps with the training and understanding what this vehicle is all about and learning, bringing all these teams together so you can make it the best possible thing.  So I appreciate you coming on today.    Jeff Fox: Thank you for having me.     [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Jeff Fox.  And he took us through a ride on Orion.  And it really felt like it, right?  I hope you actually turned up the podcast volume whenever you were listening that stuff because especially if you have, like, a theatre or something, you can really feel it.  We were in the studio editing this and it really felt like we were on that launch.  Everything was vibrating.  It was kind of awesome.  So I hope you did that.  If not, you can go back and listen to it.  But if you want to see more on Orion, you can go to our website, NASA.gov/Orion.  Actually, the Ascent Abort-2 capsule just arrived at the Johnson Space Center not too long ago and is being outfitted to start the next abort test mission.  So it's kind of cool.  Actually, if you go back to I think it's episode I want to say 25, the episode title is A Rocket on a Rocket, you can learn a little bit more about abort systems, launch abort systems.  And we're going to be doing AA2 coming up here soon.  Other than that, on NASA's website and anything Orion you can find on social media.   You can go to the Orion pages on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  On Facebook, it's NASAOrion.  Twitter it's @NASA_Orion.  And then on Instagram it's @ExploreNASA actually is one of the channels that we have that has a little bit of Orion, a little bit of SLS.  So you can see a lot of cool stuff there.  You can use the #AskNASA on your favorite platform to submit ideas for the podcast.  Maybe we'll answer it on one of the episodes or maybe we'll dedicate an entire episode to it.  So this podcast was recorded on February 7th, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Greg Wiseman, Tommy Gerczak, Rachel Craft, Laura Rochon, Brandi Dean, Kelly Humphries, and Ryan Stewart.  and I wanted to give my condolences to Jeff Fox.  He was talking about his father, Mike Fox, during this podcast and just wanted to say rest in peace.  He passed away very recently.  And I wanted to thank Jeff again for coming on the show today.  We'll be back next week."

Technicians assemble Orion’s European Service Module and Crew Module for Exploration Mission-1 and the Crew Module for Exploration Mission-2. For the first time, NASA will use a European-built system as a critical element to power an American spacecraft, extending the international cooperation of the International Space Station into deep space. The European Service Module is a unique collaboration across space agencies and industry including ESA’s prime contractor, Airbus, and 10 European countries. The completion of service module work in Europe and shipment to Kennedy signifies a major milestone toward NASA’s human deep space exploration missions to the Moon and beyond."

The team used a mockup of the spacecraft to examine how crew will get out of Orion with assistance and alone. The testing is helping NASA prepare for Orion and Space Launch System missions with crew beginning with Exploration Mission-2 in the early 2020s."
